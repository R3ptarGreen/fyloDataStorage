## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS
- BEM Method

### What I learned

This challenge was very difficult. I spend a lot of time trying to solved and learning the position absolute and relative and how to center it, meanwhile I was learning to create the Bem classes more efficiently with the scss. I'm not sure if  I have issues and bad practices with my code, I'll be working on that.


### Continued development

create the Bem classes more efficiently with the scss and try to do more practices

### Useful resources
